# Calm Studio — Project 1

This is my first practice project as a beginner web developer.

I am currently learning **HTML & CSS step by step** and building simple web pages to improve my skills.  
This project is a small personal portfolio page that includes:

- A navigation menu
- A hero section
- About me text
- Simple project cards
- Contact buttons
- A footer

My main goal is to write **clean, simple and readable code** while learning the basics of frontend development.
